The apidocs module allows us to generate documentation that is viewable on a browser

How to generate API Docs:

Foremost, you must globally download the apidoc module:
   npm install apidoc -g

Then to generate the documents:
   npm run docs

If you want to view the documentation from a browser (recommended, is pretty), then:
	go to the /docs folder and click on index.html

If you guys want, we can setup a route to our documentation, allowing others to see the documentation when server starts
